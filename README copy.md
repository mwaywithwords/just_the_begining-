# TIP CALCULATOR

# my tip calculator will ask the patrons to enter the cost of their meal, the number of people splitting the bill, and how much they are willing or able to tip percentage wise. the calculator will then give the user the total of the bill (tip included) and the sum each person is required to pay.

# some veriables i needed to creat 

the amount of the bill(user imputted)\n
the amount of tax included(fixed percantage)\n
the amount of people splitting the bill.\n
the amount of taxes combined coming from the total bill\n
the tip precentage that the petron would like to tip\n 
the number of people that will be splitting said bill, the total of the food cost + tax and tip, devided by the number of people splitting the bill'''

# the only thing needed to be inputted in order to use the tip calculator is. the cost of thr meal, number of people splitting the bill. and what tip percentage you are willing to contribuite to the bill..
